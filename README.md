# **An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns**
## **Overview of Analysis**
The purpose of this analysis is to compare various Kickstarter campaigns across the globe, their goal amounts and outcomes. There are various entertainment categories from games to theater to food trucks. We take a look to compare how these categories, the goal amount, how long it takes to reach a goal if at all, and determine what makes a successful entertainment Kickstarter.

## **Analysis and Challenges**
I took a specific look at the Theater Category based on the month a Kickstarter campaign was launched. Based on the graph below, more successful Theater campaigns started in May compared to other months. The challenge here though is that May is also the month with the most failed Theater campaigns.
