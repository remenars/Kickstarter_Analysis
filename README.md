# **An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns**
## **Overview of Analysis**
The purpose of this analysis is to compare various Kickstarter campaigns across the globe, their goal amounts and outcomes. There are various entertainment categories from games to theater to food trucks. We take a look to compare how these categories, the goal amount, how long it takes to reach a goal if at all, and determine what makes a successful entertainment Kickstarter.

## **Analysis and Challenges**
I took a specific look at the Theater Category based on the month a Kickstarter campaign was launched. Based on the graph below, more successful Theater campaigns started in May compared to other months. The challenge here though is that May is also the month with the most failed Theater campaigns. There are more successful campaigns than failed campaigns no matter what month you choose to start.

I also compared the outcomes of Kickstarter campaigns for Plays based on thier goals. At first it appears that as the goal amount increases to $20,000, the level of success decreases. However, the opposite is true if the goal is between $20,000 and $35,000. Because of the flucuations of the percentage of outcomes, it is challenging to determine if there is a correlation between goal amount and outcome.

## **Results**

Not many theater Kickstart campaigns are cancelled. There is a greater chance of success than failure but there is a fine line between the two. 

If you keep your goal on the lighter side, under $20,000, you have a good chance at a successful campaign.

Kickstarter is only one method of raising money.
